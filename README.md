# COVID-19 Global Vaccination Data Analysis
## Database-Concept-with-ER-Modelling of Global Vaccinations Dataset

This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 vaccination data to provide insights into the total number of vaccine doses administered, cumulative doses by country, vaccine types, and sources of vaccination data. The project involves writing SQL queries to retrieve and summarize key information from a dataset that includes details such as vaccination counts, countries' vaccination progress, and different types of vaccines administered. Additionally, the project includes tracking fully vaccinated individuals over time for selected countries like Australia, the United States, Germany, and Italy.

Key Features:
- Summary of Administered Vaccines by Country and Date: Provides daily vaccination totals for each country to understand the vaccine distribution trend.
- Cumulative Doses by Country: Calculates the cumulative number of administered vaccine doses across all countries to analyze overall vaccination progress.
- Vaccine Types by Country: Lists the different types of vaccines used in each country to identify the diversity of vaccine types globally.
- Total Administered Vaccines by Source Website: Aggregates the total vaccines administered based on the source website from which the data is obtained, offering transparency about data origins.
- People Fully Vaccinated Over Time for Selected Countries: Displays vaccination trends for fully vaccinated individuals in Australia, the United States, Germany, and Italy, providing insights into vaccination campaigns across these nations.

This project is essential for understanding global vaccination efforts and identifying trends in vaccine distribution and uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic.
